Each row represents a unique video game, and the columns provide details about attributes such as the game’s title, genre, platform, price, critic score, and other relevant characteristics. The data includes both numerical variables (such as price and scores) and categorical variables (such as genre and platform), making it well-suited for a variety of statistical analyses. This dataset allows us to explore trends and relationships related to game quality, popularity, pricing, and other key factors within the video game industry.\n"

In this project, if the US sales exceed 1.0 million, the game is considered successful (a value of 1), or it is classified as unsuccessful (0). This variable allows you to predict the game's chances of success, and depending on the explanatory factors, you can classify it into successful or failed categories."

This is because game developers and publishers can inform marketing strategies, game design decisions, and platform selection through insights into how attributes such as genre, console type, and release year affect sales. We also want to predict that if we can predict the potential for a blockbuster based on the features of the game, we can help companies allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize high-potential projects, and better predict market demand."

    "Our research question for the linear regression analysis is:\n",
    "\"What is the relationship between Game Genre and US Sales after accounting for Console type and Year Released, both within the current sample and in the general population? How well does the model predict sales for new, unseen data?\" The linear regression model relies on several assumptions that may not fully reflect real-world conditions. It assumes that the relationships between variables like Genre, Console, Year Released, and US Sales are strictly linear, which can oversimplify the complexities inherent in consumer behavior and market trends.\n",
    "Moreover, the model does not incorporate external factors such as marketing efforts, critical reviews, or larger economic shifts — all of which can significantly impact sales outcomes.\n",
    "Since the model is built on historical data, it may also struggle to capture future trends in the rapidly evolving video game market, limiting its predictive accuracy over time."

    "We filtered out test observations with Genre categories that were not present in the training data because the linear regression model, based on the formula API, cannot handle unseen categorical levels during prediction. Removing these observations ensures consistency between the training and testing feature spaces and allows accurate model evaluation on compatible data. The RMSE on the test data is approximately 1.17 million units. This value represents the typical deviation between the model’s predicted US Sales and the actual US Sales for new video games. Given that US Sales are measured in millions of units, an RMSE of 1.17 indicates a moderate to high level of prediction error, suggesting that while the model captures some general patterns, there is still substantial unexplained variability. Therefore, the model’s predictive performance is limited, and improvements could be made by incorporating additional relevant features such as marketing data, critical reviews, or franchise popularity."

    "Our research question is: How are Genre, Console, and Year Released associated with the log-odds of a video game achieving success (defined as surpassing 1 million units in US sales) in the training data? Furthermore, how well does a logistic regression classifier built on this model perform when applied to new test data? The logistic regression model aims to predict a game’s likelihood of success by examining how the explanatory variables (Genre, Console, and Year Released) influence the log-odds of achieving high sales. Although logistic regression is a reliable and interpretable method, it relies on certain assumptions that may not fully align with real-world complexities. In particular, it assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome, which can oversimplify more intricate relationships among variables. Additionally, the model does not account for external factors such as game quality, critical reviews, or marketing efforts, all of which can significantly impact a game’s commercial performance. Finally, the definition of success—based on exceeding 1 million units sold—is somewhat arbitrary and may not fully capture the complexities of success within the dynamic video game industry."

    "When examining the impact of genre, the category associated with the largest positive coefficient is Educational/Sports. This indicates that if a game falls into the Educational or Sports genre, the log-odds of it achieving success (defined as selling more than 1 million units) increase by 1.2126. For platform effects, the Xbox 360 stands out with a coefficient of 0.6130. This suggests that games released on the Xbox 360 have log-odds of success that are 0.6130 higher compared to the baseline platform. Regarding the year of release, 2005 emerges as the only year with a positive coefficient among the years considered, at 0.2260. This means that if a game was launched in 2005, its log-odds of success increase by 0.2260, relative to other release years."

    "We aim to reduce the number of false negatives by improving the model’s specificity. A false negative occurs when the model incorrectly predicts that a game will not be successful (US_Sales_millions ≤ 1), even though it actually is. Such errors can lead companies to underinvest in marketing and distribution efforts, or discourage them from producing similar games in the future, ultimately resulting in lost revenue opportunities. Minimizing false negatives ensures that promising games are accurately identified, allowing companies to allocate resources more confidently. This, in turn, could foster greater innovation and lead to more effective strategies for capturing market opportunities."

    "In our current classifier, both the false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) are 0.0, indicating that the model fails to correctly identify any successful games at the current threshold. This issue may stem from setting the threshold too high, inherent model limitations, or imbalances within the dataset. To improve performance, we need to focus on selecting a lower threshold that increases the TPR, even if it results in a higher FPR. Prioritizing the reduction of false negatives is crucial, as missing successful games can lead to missed opportunities in marketing, resource allocation, and future game production. Moving forward, we should experiment with lower thresholds, carefully evaluate the trade-off between TPR and FPR, and validate any new threshold to ensure better model performance and broader applicability."

    "We selected a threshold of 0.15, resulting in the following performance: FPR (7.35%): A small percentage of unsuccessful games are incorrectly classified as successful. TPR (23.33%): The model correctly identifies 23.33% of successful games, significantly improving its ability to detect positive cases. This threshold offers a balanced trade-off, reducing the risk of overlooking promising games while keeping the false positive rate at an acceptable level. It supports our broader objective of enabling better marketing and production decisions by more accurately recognizing successful titles."

    "- Linear Regression: In this linear regression analysis, we explored how Game Genre relates to US Sales after accounting for Console type and Year Released. The findings indicated that being classified under the \"Action, Adventure\" genre was linked to a modest reduction in US Sales compared to the reference genre, although this effect was not statistically significant at the 5% threshold. The model accounted for roughly 11.67% of the variation in US Sales, suggesting that while Genre, Console, and Year Released offer some predictive insight, a large portion of sales variability remains unexplained. Visual examinations of the residuals showed that the assumptions of linearity and approximate normality were largely upheld, though some signs of heteroscedasticity were present. The RMSE for the test set was approximately 1.17 million units, indicating a moderate to high prediction error and underscoring the likely influence of external factors not incorporated into the model."

The results indicated that games classified in the Educational or Sports genres had increased odds of success compared to the baseline genre, while the Xbox 360 platform and games released in 2005 were associated with higher log-odds of success.\n",
    "The model achieved a pseudo-R^2 of approximately 0.0864, suggesting that while the predictors capture some meaningful variation, a substantial portion of the factors influencing success remains unaccounted for. The model’s AUC was approximately 0.7169, indicating a reasonable ability to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful games.\n",

    "In the linear regression, the model explained only a small fraction of the variability in US Sales, indicating that important factors such as marketing efforts, brand reputation, game quality, and external economic influences were not captured.\n",
    "Additionally, residual plots showed evidence of heteroscedasticity and minor deviations from normality, suggesting that some model assumptions were only approximately satisfied.\n",
    "In the logistic regression, while the model demonstrated a reasonable ability to predict success, the pseudo-R² indicated that most of the variance remained unexplained.\n",
    "Furthermore, the logistic model assumed a linear relationship between predictors and the log-odds of success, which may oversimplify real-world complexities.\n",
    "Both models relied solely on historical features available in the dataset and did not incorporate potentially influential real-world variables, limiting the generalizability and predictive strength of the findings."
